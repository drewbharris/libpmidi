# libpmidi
A library version of Steve Ratcliffe's pmidi, an ALSA MIDI player - http://www.parabola.me.uk/alsa/pmidi.html

I've included two basic programs to demonstrate the API.

## Todo

I didn't spend a lot of time exposing a nice API or anything as I just wanted to work this into a library and move on - I'd like to have everything exposed via one header file and not depend on seqlib.h for certain things.
